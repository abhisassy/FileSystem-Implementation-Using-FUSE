# FileSystem-Implementation-Using-FUSE
University Project 

A Simple File System, implemented in C using the fuse library 
Consists of two versions:

Version 1 : persistence across different mounts </br>
Version 2 : persistence in secondary storage

Run the make-file, and make sure the main.c , implementation.c and header.c files are in the same directory.
